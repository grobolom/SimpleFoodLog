                <h5>How does it work?</h5>
                <p>Please enter the food, followed by the number of calories, as follows:</p>
                <p><em>A delicious choripan sandwich 250</em></p>
                <p>you may also put 'calories' or 'kcal' or 'c' or 'cal' at the end - the log will handle all of it. Once you've typed out your food and hit enter, it will get saved to your log and get tracked for the next rolling week.</p>

                <h5>Why did I build it?</h5>
                <p>Food logs are too complex. I don't need all the fancy recipe lookups and repeated meals. I just want to put in the calories and walk away. Here's the result.</p>
                <h5>Got a problem with SFL?</h5>
                <p>Please visit the <a href='https://github.com/grobolom/SimpleFoodLog/issues'>issue tracker on Github</a> or check out the <a href='https://trello.com/b/h8ZF33oO'>Trello board</a> in case I'm already working on your issue.</p>
                <h5>It's broken!</h5>
                <p>This project is still a work in progress. I'm trying to keep it functional but sometimes I'll be making breaking changes. Either way, check the issue tracker and trello - I might be working on a fix already.</p>
